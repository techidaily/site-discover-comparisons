## Article Summary

1. **Scan the Computer** – Run a full system virus scan on your computer system using a reliable Antimalware program. [TotalAV is my favorite](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).
2. **Remove Adware** – After completing the scan, program will get rid of all the instances of Rankbet ads and stop its spread.
3. **Stay Protected** – We strongly suggest doing research on the software you want to download and only getting it from authorized/verified sources. When installing a new programme, you must be careful of unwanted check boxes which leads to adware installation.

We received a sample from a user that, when installed, turned out to be Adware for Mac. Its called Rankbet which inserts advertisements all over the places. Let’s understand how to get rid of it and secure your Mac OS device.

RankBet is a virus that displays ads and affects Mac users. Once RankBet is in the Mac operating system, it will start showing ads on all visited websites and in notifications.

## Rankbet Adware in Details

Rankbet is ad-supported software that puts ads on the websites you visit and other parts of the computer. Its only purpose is to make money and/or send people to pages that interest the makers. These websites could be dangerous or not trustworthy, or they could be online scams or even malware.

This adware can also track private information like your browser history, search terms, and how you use the Internet. If your computer does strange things, like pop-ups that you didn’t ask for or changes to how your web browser works, you probably have this type of malware.

To sum up, having software like RankBet on a device can cause malware infections, serious privacy problems, financial losses, and even identity theft.

## How did Rankbet Install on my Computer?

Adware is spread by “bundling,” which means adding unwanted or harmful program to genuine app installers before they are installed. When you download from suspicious sites (like unofficial or freeware sites, P2P networks, etc.) or rush through the installation process, you might let bundled content into your system.

Adware is full of annoying advertisements. Some of the ads, when clicked on, can run scripts that download or install things without the user’s permission. There are also fake Adobe Flash Player installers and updaters that are used to spread malware.

Software that is paid for by ads can also have “official” pages that promote it, and it is often pushed through scam websites. Most people get to these sites through redirects caused by websites that use rogue advertising networks, annoying ads, wrong URLs, spam browser notifications, or adware (with browser force-opening capabilities).
