## Analysing Online File Converters

### Is ilovePDF safe? [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)

First up, we have ilovePDF. According to their privacy policy, they seem to hold high regard for your confidential documents. They promise that any file you upload and process is encrypted and deleted from their servers within a cool 2-hour window. So, it seems we can breathe a sigh of relief with ilovePDF, right?

### Is Convertio safe? [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)

Next in line, we have Convertio. Just like ilovePDF, Convertio seems to be playing by the rules. They assure users that both input and output files are deleted post-conversion, either automatically or manually. Plus, the cherry on top? Each conversion gets its private, sandboxed environment. So, it’s all about you and your files, with no prying eyes involved. Not too shabby, Convertio!

### Is MConverter safe? [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)

MConverter appears to be a safe bet too. As per their terms of service, your uploaded files are neither given out nor sold to anyone. All processing is machine-based, with zero human interaction. They’re also pretty prompt with their clean-up – files from successful conversions are deleted within 4 hours, and erroneous conversion files are given a maximum 36-hour lifespan on their servers. You can even initiate a manual deletion with a simple click of the ‘DELETE NOW’ button. So, it’s safe to say MConverter is taking care of business.

### Is CloudConvert safe? [✅](https://emojipedia.org/check-mark-button)

CloudConvert, like its counterparts, guarantees that your files are deleted immediately and irreversibly from their servers once you hit the delete button. If you forget, they’ve got you covered – deletion automatically happens at the latest after 24 hours. So, CloudConvert seems to be on the ball when it comes to your file safety.

### Is Zamzar safe? ❌

Unfortunately, every list has its black sheep, and for us, it’s Zamzar. They’re a bit vague about how they handle user-uploaded files and conversion outputs. According to their Terms of Use, they can’t guarantee that user files or converted files won’t be deleted or lost. A bit sketchy, isn’t it?  
  
What’s more, even though Zamzar offers a desktop application, it’s not entirely offline. Your files are still uploaded online for conversion and then downloaded post-conversion. So it seems, with Zamzar, you might be playing a game of cyber roulette.

## Risks of using Online File Converters?

Let’s dive straight into the deep end, shall we? You need to be aware of a couple of significant risks tied to using online file converters. And no, we’re not just talking about the annoyance of pop-up ads. We’re talking serious stuff here: Malware Infections and Privacy Breaches.

**Malware Infection** : Imagine this: you’ve just converted that crucial file, and you’re ready to download it. But, instead of getting your neatly converted file, you’re inviting a hidden virus to your computer. It’s like inviting a vampire into your house, but worse—this one can mess with your digital life.  
  
This is not some far-fetched story. According to [IT Governance research](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/list-of-data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-2023), in 2023 alone, 2,814 incidents led to an alarming 8,214,886,660 records being breached. Yes, that’s billions with a ‘B’. And guess what? One of these incidents originated from a media conversion tool.

**Privacy** : Now, let’s move on to the second risk: privacy. Sure, legitimate file converters don’t meddle with your uploaded files, and they get auto-deleted after some hours. But what if you’re dealing with confidential information? It’s like leaving your front door wide open for anyone to snoop around. Not ideal, is it?

## Which is a Safe File Converter?

So, what’s the solution? It’s simple, really. A safe file converter is one that doesn’t interact with the internet. This way, your files remain safely on your computer. But here’s a word of caution: don’t just go for any free offline file converter.

Free software developers need to make ends meet too. They might bundle some tools and browser extensions into their installer—leading to the risk of [Potentially Unwanted Programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) (PUP). It’s like getting a free puppy, only to realize it chews all your furniture.

### Trusted File Converters

For media conversion purposes, [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) is a reliable choice. It’s a friendly, easy-to-use tool available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

If you’re dealing with documents, especially PDFs, then [PDF24 Creator](https://tools.pdf24.org/en/creator) is your go-to tool. However, it’s only available for Windows OS.
