## Latest Virus Threats

### Clop Ransomware

Clop is the latest and one of the most deadly ransomware threats. [Ransomware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) is a type of malware that encrypts the files and folder and asks for the ransom in return for the decrypting tool or key after infiltrating into the system. Clop is one of the variants of the CryptoMix ransomware. Clop was first discovered in 2018, and since then, it has evolved so much that it even targets the network other than the individual system. 

Recently, Clop targeted one of the biggest software companies in the world, [**Software AG**](https://www.softwareag.com/en%5Fcorporate.html). It has demanded a whopping $20 million for the decryption.

### Zeus Gameover

Zeus Gameover is a type of trojan malware that disguises itself as an essential and legitimate application. It then gets access to your sensitive bank details and steals your money.
