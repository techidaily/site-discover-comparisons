However, cyberattackers have found ways to enter the user’s system through legitimate methods. One of those is **Pop-Ups.** Since Chrome is the most used web browser, it is largely targeted with the pop-up virus.

## What is a Pop-Up Virus in Chrome?

Pop-up ads are basically meant for the businesses to inform their customers of the new product release, latest offers, new happening, and more. It is quite a cost-effective advertising tool for companies, especially for new startups and enterprises.

However, in recent times the reputation of the pop-ups is totally maligned. Cybercriminals vigorously exploit this feature of the browsers and use it to infect the users’ computers with [malicious programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)and files. Clicking on any of the malicious sites’ pop-ups can infect your system with malware, or you would be redirected to the webpages that silently inject the ill-disposed files in the background.

Today, for most users, pop-up ads are nothing but the irritating entities that spoil their web browsing experience.

## Why Do Pop-ups Keep Appearing on My Chrome?

As already mentioned, there could be both legitimate and illegitimate reasons for the pop-ups to appear on the Chrome web browser. The valid reasons could be:

* If you have visited a product site, then a pop-up can appear asking you to buy the product or providing you the discount offers.
* While you are any blog site, a pop-up may emerge, asking you to subscribe to the newsletter.
* When you are reading any blog post, a pop-up may pop at the end that may ask you to share the post with others.
* Based on your browsing experience, search history, or saved cookies, related pop-up ads can appear.

However, there could be several wrong reasons that can trigger the pop-up appearance.

* There could be an [Adware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) installed on your system that is continuously popping irrelevant ads for generating revenues through pay per click.
* You might have visited any malicious site that is bombarding your browser with pop-up ads.
* It is also possible that a [browser hijacker](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) has compromised your browser, causing the irrelevant pop-ups.

## How to Enable Chrome’s Pop-Up Blocker?

If you have crossed your frustration limit and now blocking the pop-ups is the only option, you can follow these steps on the Chrome browser.

1. Open Chrome and navigate to **Settings.**  
![Chrome Settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrome-Malware-Scanner-1-1.png)
2. Scroll down and under **Privacy and security,** click on **Site Settings.**  
![Choose site settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Choose-site-settings.jpg)
3. On the next window, look for the **Content** and under it click on **Pop-ups and redirects**.  

![pop ups](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pop-ups.png)
4. Now you have several options here. You can permanently block the pop-ups on Chrome by turning-off the switch next to **Allowed.** Otherwise, you can add the specific sites in the block list by clicking on **Add** next to Block. To block the sites that are allowed to send pop-ups, click on the three dots next to the site name and select **Block.**![Block popups](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/block-popups.png)

## Remove the Pop-Up Causing Malware

As you already know, the pop-ups can also appear because of the malware infection to your system. So to fix that, you must remove malware from the device. Here are the ways to do that.

### **Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system. [Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in the **Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Remove Web Extensions From Browser**

You might have accidentally installed a malicious browser web extension that is causing the pop-ups.

If you have many web extensions installed in your Chrome browser, it is time to sort them out and at least disable, if not delete, the ones you rarely use. However, you must remove the useless web extensions instead of disabling them. Because, even after disabling them, they might use the CPU processing power while checking for updates and performing updates.

Here are the steps to manage the web extensions on the Chrome Browser:

1. Click on the three dots at the top-right corner.
2. Bring mouse cursor over **More tools** and from the extended menu choose **Extensions**.![Extensions settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Extensions-settings.png)
3. Now, all the extensions would be on your screen

## Final Words

Pop-ups are not that harmful to the system; however, continuous bombarding can frustrate the user and deteriorate the workflow. Further, it can also slow down browsing. Ultimately, it is up to the user whether they want pop-ups from some legit site or not.

**1\. Can I enable pop-ups for specific sites?** 

YES. On Google Chrome, you can enable pop-ups for the specific sites for which you are sure that they are safe.

**2\. Can my PC get a virus just by clicking on the pop-up?** 

Technically, your system can’t get a virus just by clicking on the pop-up. However, clicking on the malicious pop-up can initiate the process of virus or malware attack on your browser.
