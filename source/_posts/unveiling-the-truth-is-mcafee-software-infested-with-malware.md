## Unveiling the Truth: Is McAfee Software Infested with Malware?

Let’s clear the air – McAfee is not a virus. In fact, it’s quite the contrary. McAfee is a legitimate antivirus program with a rich history dating back to 1987 when it became the first commercially available antivirus solution. But why do some users see it as an unwelcome intruder? Let’s dig in.

## The McAfee Origin Story: From Antivirus Pioneer to Controversial App

John McAfee, the brain behind this antivirus, introduced it to the world in 1987\. The product has since been under the ownership of Intel and then Intel security group. Over the years, it has [consistently performed well](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) in protection tests conducted by independent labs.  
  
But, things aren’t as rosy as they seem. Changes in ownership have led to changes in the product’s intention and direction, leading to user frustrations. Some even liken its intrusive behavior to that of a virus. Can you believe that?

Here’s a snapshot of the question posted by a frustrated user on McAfee forum.

## McAfee Pop-Ups

One of the main gripes users have with McAfee is its incessant pop-ups asking for upgrades and payments. Imagine enjoying your morning coffee, browsing the web when suddenly, \*bam\* – a McAfee pop-up asking you to upgrade. It’s like having someone constantly knocking on your door asking you to buy something. Not cool, right?  
  
Worse still, scamsters have seized this opportunity to use McAfee’s name and reputation to their advantage. They create malicious browser extensions and push fake notifications, all in the name of McAfee. Navigating these murky waters requires you to differentiate between the genuine and the fake.

## Should you continue using McAfee?

So, should you stick with McAfee or give it the boot? Well, it’s not all doom and gloom. McAfee is still capable of fending off malware and providing decent protection. But if its behavior leaves you pulling your hair out, you can [uninstall it](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) and consider other reliable antimalware program.  
  
If you’ve paid for a subscription, make sure you cancel any auto-renewals. Because the last thing you want is to be paying for a service you’re not happy with. 

And here’s the kicker – even John McAfee himself isn’t too thrilled about the current state of his namesake product. He even released a reaction video, albeit NSFW, expressing his frustrations. So, if you’re feeling exasperated, remember you’re in good company.
